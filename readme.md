### Helpful Resources

Here are some links to some methods that may help you. They are not required. You can complete this exercise without using any -- well, most -- of these.

[`.prompt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)  
  * **tl;dr:** Asking for user input.

[`.replace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)  
  * **tl;dr:** Replace characters with other characters.

[`.includes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)  
  * **tl;dr:** Check if array contains a value.

[`.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes)  
  * **tl;dr:** Find all elements in array that match a condition.

[`.match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)  
  * **tl;dr:** Check if characters in a string match a regular expression.  
  ```js
  "abc".match(/a/) // => ["a"]
  "abc".match(/d/) // => null
  ```

### Bonus (Lvl. 1)

* Allow the user to play again after win/loss without refreshing the page.

### Bonus (Lvl. 2)

* Create a menu that shows up when you start and win/lose the game. [Inspiration](https://gieseanw.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/hangman_banner.jpg?w=900&h=424).

```text
# Insert text here
```

### Bonus (Lvl. 3)

* Draw ASCII art to represent guesses remaining with an actual hangman.
